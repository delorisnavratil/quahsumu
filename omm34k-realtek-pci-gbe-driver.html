Just got KaM and was told that their was a remake mod that fixes a lot of the problems the game has; random crashing, AI issues, etc. My problem is that the remake will crash immediately on start up and give me an error code. I've tried going to their forums for advice but I seem to be the only one with this issue and the forums itself has yet to send me a activation email for new account. Figured I try here.

Each time I record the reasoning and I take necessary measures to redeem the issues, the problems still exist. I've even taken my PC into GeekSquad \ eye roll\ to no avail. My guess is it's all of my outdated drivers. I have a list of what needs to be updated but I'd like to know if all listed are required/important. Some of these drivers are harder than others to locate without acquiring third party viruses. Offer what you can, I greatly appre. Relatively new self built PC. Ran fine for a couple months now I'm starting to get random crashes from no where. Can't seem to track down a cause with my knowledge base. Ran the basics, malware-bytes, windows defender, looked through event viewer, reliability monitor and process monitor but can't seem to find a culprit. Most events only record as unexpected shutdown. No signs of heat damage, all cables secure and connected. ampnbsp; Honestly I've been kind of lost since upgrading.

Hello,I am a web developper and am currently working on a Symfony 4 website, this is already off topic I know but it was to let you know that it would save my life to find the solution to this issue as soon as possible.Anyway as you've seen in the title, since yesterday, every common type of internet connection stopped working on my elementaryOS, when I plug an Ethernet source it says "connecting" and then offline some time later, and Wifi is completely not there (I don't  Hello, all! My computer decided to randomly shut down the other day while I was playing Fallout 4. I turned it back on and everything seemed normal, but when I booted up Chrome, the computer died again. Both times the code it posted was that it had detected a power surge, and shut off. The computer then had difficulty turning back on again, or powering all the devices. This loop continued until I shut it down completely, figuring it to be a PSU problem. I ordered a new one off Amazon Two days ago, there was a Windows update pending, so I let it update and shut down. I'm not sure if this is directly connected to my problem, but after that update, the next day, my internet was no longer working. I ran the Windows troubleshooter and it gave me "Wi-fi doesn't have a valid IP configuration - Not fixed" result. Same thing happens with wired connection, then it displays "Ethernet doesn't have a valid IP configuration - Not fixed" result. Wi-fi works on all other devices I ran Driver Booster 3 which corrupted my Ethernet driver Realtek PCIe GBE Family COntroller and my Wireless LAN Realtek 8821AE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC 1-I have tried rolling back the drivers which didnt do anything 2-I have tried uninstalling the drivers and letting windows reinstall which gives me the error "Windows found your drivers but failed to install them Time out" 3-I tries starting in safe mode and reinstalling the drivers 4- I tried installing the most recent official. I recently picked up a D-Link AC1750 wireless router today to replace my old Linksys EA3500 router after factory resetting would no longer fix its issues. I set it up and it works fine for every ethernet and wireless connection in the house except for my computer. Windows is saying the network cable is unplugged and the network port lights do not light up when an ethernet cable is plugged in. The network interface is an onboard Realtek PCIe GBE Family controller. Device Manager is saying ''' FIXED, had to uninstall/purge my nvidia drivers Been trying to troubleshoot this issue, but I'm coming up short. Could use advice or tips on how to remedy this situation. Only started happening after I began a Linux update yesterday to what I believe is Linux 4.14.0 or 4.14.12 but I cannot check because my os won't boot now. Here is my system information: Processor - Intel (R) Core(TM) i7-6500 CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2601 Mhz Manufacturer - Acer Model - Aspire E5-575G_1094_1.04 System.

My PC started acting up a couple of days ago. First it was just tiny hickups that lasted less than a second, like the stuff you get when you install a graphics card driver. The day before yesterday it started freaking out like this from time to time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IZPrt8CQh4 My first thought was that the GPU is busted, hence I threw my Radeon R390 out (still got warranty and Amazon refunds it, means free upgrade to XFX RX 580) and popped my old Radeon 6850 in until the repla. Whilest playing Fallout New Vegas, without any recent changes to GPU or graphical settings, several artifacts appeared after a brief stutter in game. Rebooting PC, safe mode, down- or upgrading drivers, changing monitor, changing monitor cable, and changing GPU to second PCI slot has not resolved the issue. Completely removing GPU driver has however resolves the issue untill installing a driver. Looking for input on how to proceed, planning to replace GPU with an older card to see if problem. I am pretty new to this VMWare so please forgive me if it sounds like I don't know what I am doing, because I don't. I am using a home computer as a server and when I try to install ESXi 6.5 through a bootable USB it gives me the previous error. I have researched and I concluded that I need to inject NIC drivers into the ESXi iso image. I have used the ESXi-Customizer(NOT ESXi-Customizer-PS) to create the custom iso by injecting NIC drivers. However, I still get the error. I am sure I am using. Hey, I am the IT guy for a decent sized company, I fix things like this at work all day, maybe I'm overlooking something simple here. I have a laptop and a PC at home, both are Windows 10, Last night I used the PC and laptop as normal, no problems. I get home from work today, no one else has been in this house since I left this morning. I turn them both on. The laptop connects to the wifi just fine, but my PC is saying my Ethernet is not connected and the picture in network settings Every other device I have is working on the home wifi network. My computer works with every other wifi network but for some reason all the sudden these two won't cooperate. I've flushed the DNS, uninstalled the driver, not sure what else to try here.

Hello, as you could see, I am having trouble maintaining 144+ fps. I have capped it at 146 fps and at matche all around it's fine and very rarely drops to 130, other times it feels like having 125 average fps by constantly dropping from 146 to about 100-120. My thoughts are that CPU is bottlenecking, but it never reaches 100%, fps starts to drop to 125 from 146 at about 90-95% CPU usage. I use MSI Afterburner to keep an eye on the temperatures and CPU's stays at 60-67 Celsius. Meanwhile 
I don't know if it's possible to tell my that, but I'm putting my entire DxDiag on here. It might save me a trip to the store.

OS: Win 7 Ultimate, Network Adapter: Realtek RTL8168D/8111D Family PCI-E GBE I've been trouble shooting this problem and nothing seems to work. At first, the error message said an Ethernet cable was unplugged, and then it read "Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller adapter is experiencing driver- or hardware-related problems". So far I've uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers, power cycled the PC/router/modem, switched out the cables, and tested the connection on my other PC (everything worked. Hello Reddit stressed out me talking. So I just built my computer 5 days ago but due to complications I cannot get my network card to work. It hasn't worked at all. My build is https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KJhGCy. I have 4 PCI express slots and I have filled up 2 of them with my network card and my 1050ti. So I go to device manager to update my drivers because that is the only problem my computer says exists. I try to update my drivers for my Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller I have a ASUS M11BB pre-made tower.

And for whatever path what parts would be best. I have an HP Pavillion dm4. After downloading Windows 10, I receive a "No wireless connections are available" message every time my computer restarts or turns on. The F12 wifi button remains orange/off unless I go to Device ManagergtNetwork Adapters and run the "scan for hardware changes" option on two of the drivers, which turns my wifi on, and illuminates my blue/on light on the F12 key. The drivers in question are Intel Centrino Advanced N-6250 AGN, and Intel Centrino WiMAX 6250. ダウンロードファイルは自己解凍形式で圧縮されています。 ダウンロードファイルを格納するための、作業用フォルダを. Common Stock Quote. Shareholder's meeting.
