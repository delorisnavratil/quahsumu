                            <p> Recently acquired from a friend as an upgrade from my GTX 670, and crashes upon game launch. Wiped old Nvidia drivers, installed latest AMD drivers. See video below.

Built it three months ago, need money so I'm selling it now. Whether or not you choose to believe me is up to you, but I will say this: I used this computer for around 5-7 hours a day and never mined Hey Reddit, I'm a vfx and animation student finishing up school. I value stability most for my work. I need to upgrade to windows 10. I'm pretty nervous because I have a ton of projects coming up. Sadly ASUS doesnt have all the drivers, only some. There is sparkyboy on the forums who has been pretty helpful though. Anyone out there using a RIVBE sucessfully witn windows 10? I need only the essentials, dont care about AI suite or whatever. amp#x200B.

Hello, I have a problem with my new pc. Everytime, shortly after booting, the PC freezes. I'm still able to move the mouse but I can't interact with anything - can't open the task manager either. Only thing that helps is a hard reset. After that the PC boots just fine and problem will not happen again. It seems like the freeze only happens when the PC was powered off for a longer time prior. The event viewer will say "The previous system shutdown was unexpected." and "The system has rebooted. 
Hello, First off I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit. I couldn't find any specific subs for the previous games and this one seemed to be the general one, so I decided to use it. :) Now, to the point: I have bought this laptop like 5 months ago and as far as I can tell, it should be able to run ARMA2 CO (Steam) quite well. --------------------------------------------------------------- Acer Aspire V15 Nitro (Black Edition) Windows 10 64bit Intel ® Core™ i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz. I have a GTX 1070 and I am running an overclock, but when I play Minecraft (Windows 10 Edition) weird artifacts pop up in and out on the screen. The artifacts are black lines popping up randomly around the screen. This does not happen with any other game I own. Any ideas? If it is the OC, I would prefer not have to lower or disable it just for MC. EDIT: Here is an example of it at its worst https://imgur.com/a/E71Xk. I have an Acer Aspire v15 nitro black edition, Windows 10, with a Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 Wireless Network Driver, and i just noticed that if I run a ping test (ping google.it -t) on the laptop i get some latency spikes every 5-10 seconds, up to 130 ms, whereas if I run a ping test on my phone i get stable latency with almost no lag spikes (around 60 ms). I have a wireless repeater at home but I also tried connecting to the main router from 2 meters and I still get the latency spikes. I think. 
TL;DR - Western Digital Black Edition Drive Booting Partitions formatted in GPT disappear from BIOS after Windows reboot command is issued when using Creator Edition. Full Version: We have discovered that the Creator Edition in combination with a Western Digital Black Edition 2TB drive will cause a motherboard BIOS to lose the Hard Drive once the reboot command is issued (either via CMD.EXE C:\shutdown -r or through the startup menu.) Once it occurs you must power off the system Acer Aspite V15 Nitro Black Edition, Windows 10. Sound volume is normally low, even if everything is maxxed. BUT when screen goes automatically off after a while of inactivity, sound volume is significantly increased. Any ideas of what may be happening. ###The problem: Like the title says, Flash crashes and leaves an error message ( and a dump file ( ###What I've tried: I've re-installed the driver many times and this still happens. Quite annoying because the primary reason why I bought this tablet is to animate in Flash. As for re-installing CS6, pretty sure it wouldn't make a different because it seems to be more of a tablet-. Hello, first off let me say I am not exactly well versed in terms of Hardware or Software so do have a bit of patience please. :) Also sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. About 4 months ago I've bought an Acer Aspire V15 Nitro (Black Edition) laptop and everything seemed to work as it should have. However, now I seem to have the annoying issue in the header and more. I also updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 (free) but I can't exactly pinpoint whether. When using the Oculus and playing Minecraft through the Oculus store, all the textures are black. I have seen that this is a common issue. Has anyone managed to get it working. Hi everyone, upgraded my computers today and now I got a problem with no desktop/black screen after I login to my account. This only happens on my laptop and not my desktop I built. I can still ctrl+alt+del to open task manager and launch apps (Im talking to you guys on the same computer, so it is working somewhat), I tried manually launching C:\windows\explorer.exe to get the dekstop back but nothing happens. Anyone else run into this?
